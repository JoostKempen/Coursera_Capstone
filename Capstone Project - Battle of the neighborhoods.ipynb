Research/business problem**\n\t\nOver the last years, the housing market has been overcrowded in the Netherlands making it very difficult for starters to buy their own house. Viewings are almost always fully booked and even if you get a spot during these viewings the bidding process is fierce. It usually comes down to who wants to pay the most on top of what has already been asked by the seller and how quick you are to act. People start to ignore their wish list on how their ideal house should look like just to get a hold on something. At this moment, there is just not enough time for potential buyers to look into the details of a house, where it is located, if the area is kid friendly, how are the restaurants, and so on. \n\tHaving a quick overview of how neighborhoods look like and if it matches your needs is key in this market. If a house becomes available you would know in a matter of hours, maybe even minutes, if this is the house you are looking for. The buyer would be less dependent on advisors to tell them is a house fulfill their needs and would be able to compare houses far more in depth than they were used to do.\n\tIn this research there will be a loop on the Amsterdam area in the Netherlands. Tilburg is one of the big student cities in the Netherlands resulting in a lot of graduates looking for a home when they start their working life. Similar to the rest of the Netherlands, in Amsterdam the housing market is overcrowded. For every house that comes available on the market, there are at least 50 potential buyers who want to schedule a viewing. Students tend to search for a house in the neighborhood where they rented during their student life. However, Amsterdam has a lot more to offer than only that neighborhood. The problem is that students do not know enough about these neighborhoods and do not have the luxury of time to investigate when a house comes available.\n\tThere are many factors that can be considered when comparing neighborhoods. To narrow the scope of this research, the research question will be limited to different types (Chinese, Indian, Italian, native Dutch, ect\u2026) of restaurants in the area and how they are rated, assuming this is an important reason for students to live in that area. The same approach could be applied for different elements of neighborhood such as a good school or the number of sport associations nearby. This leads into the following research question:\n\n*In which neighborhood is it best to buy a house based on the preference for a type of restaurant in that area?*\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "***"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "**2. Data description**\n\nLocation data from neighborhoods in the Amsterdam area are taken from the Foursquare API database. From the database, this research will in particular look at the neighborhood names, the restaurants in the area, restaurant type, and the reviews from those areas to specify in which neighborhoods you have the best restaurants for a specific dish or type of food to answer the research question. In case the results lead to relevant sub questions for a specific neighborhood additional data could be added to the data frame to deep dive into these additional questions.\n\tThe starting point of the data will be different types of restaurants after which the code will search for the neighborhood which scores best for that particular type of food. For example, the starting point would be to find the best place to buy a house if you are a big fan of Italian food. The code will rank the neighborhoods in Amsterdam where it is best to live based on the preference for Italian food. The same sequence will be performed for other types of food such as Chinese, Indian, or others.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "-----------------"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Week 2"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
